# Rules 
THavalon follows the same rules as The Resistance: Avalon, with the modifications and exceptions listed below. If there is a conflict between the rules of Avalon and the rules of THavalon, then use the rules of THavalon. (If you encounter such a conflict, please submit an issue so that we can investigate and resolve the conflict).

## Good Roles
- *Merlin*: sees all players that are either Evil (except Mordred) or are Lancelot; can be Assassinated.
- *Percival*: sees Merlin and Morgana, but cannot distinguish which role each seen player has.
- *Tristan* and *Iseult*: see each other; always appear together; can be Assassinated as a pair.
- *Lancelot*: may play Reversal cards while on missions; appears Evil to Merlin.
- *Nimue* (5): knows which roles are in the game; can be Assassinated. 
- *Arthur* (7+): knows which Good roles are present; may declare after 2 Failed and 0-1 Successful missions to make their votes on mission proposals count twice, but lose the ability to be on mission teams until the 5th mission.
- *Titania* (7+): appears as Evil to Evil roles (except Colgrevance). 

## Evil Roles
- *Mordred*: is hidden from Merlin.
- *Morgana*: appears like Merlin to Percival. 
- *Maelagant*: may play Reversal cards while on missions.
- *Agravaine* (8+):  must play Fails; may declare after having been on a successful mission to cause it to Fail instead.
- *Colgrevance* (10): is hidden from other Evil roles; knows which player has each Evil role.

## Proposals 
In each round, players take turns proposing teams with the appropriate number of players. During the first round, only two players are permitted to make proposals; in subsequent rounds, there may be a number of proposals up to one more than the number of Evil players in the game (e.g. 3 proposals for 5- and 6-player, 4 proposals for 7-, 8-, and 9- player, and 5 proposals for 10 player). When making a proposal, the leader of the mission selects an appropriate number of people for the mission and submits their final selection for voting. 

## Voting 
Voting in THavalon functions identically to voting in the base game, except with respect to the last mission proposal of a round. If a proposal is the last proposal of the round, the voting phase is skipped and the selected team immediately goes on the mission.

## Going on Missions
Once a team has been sent on a mission, each person on that team may choose which card they wish to play. Good players must play Success cards and Evil players may choose to play either Success or Fail. Lancelot and Maelegant are also able to play Reverse cards, and Agravaine may only play Fail cards. Once all players on the team have submitted their selected card, the result of the mission, including which cards were played, is made publicly available. 

A mission Fails if at least one Fail card and an even number of Reverse cards are played, or if an odd number of Reverse cards and no Fail cards are played. In games with at least 7 players, the fourth mission Fails if at least two Fail cards and an even number of Reverse cards are played, or if one Fail card and an odd number of Reverse cards are played. In all other situations, the mission Succeeds. 

In situations where Agravaine may declare (a mission that Succeeded despite at least one Fail card being played in a game with at least 8 players), the player who is Agravaine may formally declare as Agravaine to cause the mission to Fail. Agravaine must make this declaration before the next team proposal is voted on; Agravaine declaring after a proposal has been finalized but prior to voting allows the current proposer to change their team prior to voting. 

If a mission Succeeding or Failing would result in there being three Successful or Failed missions, the game ends and the winning team is declared. Good wins if 3 missions have Succeeded, and Evil wins if 3 missions have Failed. If Good wins, the game moves into the Assassination phase.

## Assassination 
Once the Good team has won, the Evil team is permitted one final chance at winning the game by correctly identifying one of the priority targets (Merlin; Tristan and Iseult; Nimue). One player on the Evil team is selected as the Assassin, and is given the final say on who the Evil team would like to assassinate. Currently, the Assassin may choose whether to assassinate one person as Merlin, one person as Nimue, or two people as Lovers. Evil is welcome to discuss amongst themselves who they wish to kill, but the decision is not finalized until the Assassin says "I assassinate <player(s)> as <role(s)". If Evil has correctly identified Merlin or both Lovers, Evil wins; otherwise, Good maintains their victory.
